# SmartFoodAI Backend üåø  
**Empowering Smarter Food Choices with AI**  

SmartFoodAI is a backend solution designed to process nutritional information from packaged food labels, enabling users to make informed, healthier decisions. This application leverages cutting-edge AI models, including **Meta's Llama 3.2**, running locally using **OLMa** for privacy and efficiency.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **OCR on Device:** The app uses on-device OCR to capture food label information, ensuring user privacy.  
2. **Backend Processing:**  
   - **API 1 - Health Insights:** Evaluates the extracted elements against a trained dataset, providing a binary health suggestion (*Healthy* or *Unhealthy*).  
   - **API 2 - Detailed Descriptions:** Analyzes and returns detailed information about the individual components detected in the OCR output.  

The backend APIs are optimized for local computation with **OLMa**, offering a responsive and private experience without reliance on cloud processing.
